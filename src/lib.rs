A cross-platform window management crate with async-first APIs.

![logo](../../../art/logo.png)

`app_window` provides a modern alternative to winit for creating and managing windows across
Windows, macOS, Linux, and WebAssembly. The crate's primary goal is to provide a unified,
async-first API that works seamlessly across platforms with wildly different threading
requirements.

# Key Features

- **Async-first design**: All APIs are async functions that can be called from any thread
- **Modern platform backends**: Win32 on Windows, AppKit on macOS, Wayland on Linux, Canvas on Web
- **Unified threading model**: Works correctly whether the platform requires UI on the main thread or not
- **Graphics API integration**: Provides `raw-window-handle` for wgpu, OpenGL, Vulkan, etc.
- **Built-in input handling**: Cross-platform keyboard and mouse support
- **Executor-agnostic**: Works with any async runtime via [`some_executor`](https://sealedabstract.com/code/some_executor)

# Quick Start

First, initialize the application from your main function:

```no_run
// ALLOW_NORUN_DOCTEST: application::main() must be called from the actual main thread, which is not available in doctests
use app_window::application;
fn main() {
    application::main(|| {
        // Your application code here
        async fn run() {
            // Create windows, handle events, etc.
        }
        futures::executor::block_on(run());
    });
}
#[allow(clippy::needless_doctest_main)]
```

Then create windows from any async context:

```
# async fn example() {
use app_window::{window::Window, coordinates::{Position, Size}};

// Create a window at a specific position
let window = Window::new(
    Position::new(100.0, 100.0),
    Size::new(800.0, 600.0),
    "My Application".to_string()
).await;

// The window stays open as long as the Window instance exists
// When dropped, the window automatically closes
# }
```

# Design Principles

## 1. Async-First API

Unlike traditional windowing libraries, `app_window` uses async functions throughout.
This design elegantly handles platform differences:

```
# async fn example() {
use app_window::window::Window;

// This works on any thread, on any platform
let window = Window::default().await;

// Platform-specific threading is handled internally:
// - On macOS: dispatched to main thread
// - On Windows/Linux: may run on current thread
// - On Web: runs on the single thread
# }
```

## 2. Window Lifetime Management

Windows are tied to their Rust object lifetime. No manual cleanup needed:

```
# async fn example() {
use app_window::window::Window;

{
    let window = Window::default().await;
    // Window is open and visible
} // Window automatically closes when dropped
# }
```

## 3. Platform-Specific Strategies

The crate provides platform-specific strategies for graphics APIs:

```
use app_window::{WGPU_STRATEGY, WGPUStrategy};

match WGPU_STRATEGY {
    WGPUStrategy::MainThread => {
        // Platform requires wgpu on main thread (Web, some macOS configs)
    }
    WGPUStrategy::NotMainThread => {
        // Platform requires wgpu NOT on main thread (Linux/Wayland)
    }
    WGPUStrategy::Relaxed => {
        // Platform allows wgpu on any thread (Windows, most macOS)
    }
    _ => {
        // Future-proof: handle any new strategies
        // Default to the safest option
    }
}
```

# Threading Model

This crate abstracts over platform threading differences:

- **macOS**: All UI operations dispatched to main thread via GCD
- **Windows**: UI operations can run on any thread
- **Linux (Wayland)**: Compositor-dependent, handled per-connection
- **WebAssembly**: Single-threaded, operations run directly

You write the same async code for all platforms:

```
# async fn example() {
use app_window::application;

// This works everywhere, regardless of platform requirements
let result = application::on_main_thread("my_task".to_string(), || {
    // Guaranteed to run on main thread
    42
}).await;
# }
```

# Examples

## Creating a fullscreen window

```
# async fn example() {
use app_window::window::Window;

match Window::fullscreen("My Game".to_string()).await {
    Ok(mut window) => {
        // Fullscreen window created
        let surface = window.surface().await;
        // Set up rendering...
    }
    Err(e) => eprintln!("Failed to create fullscreen window: {:?}", e),
}
# }
```

## Handling window resize

```
# async fn example() {
use app_window::{window::Window, coordinates::Size};

let mut window = Window::default().await;
let mut surface = window.surface().await;

// Register a callback for size changes
surface.size_update(|new_size: Size| {
    println!("Window resized to {}x{}", new_size.width(), new_size.height());
    // Update your rendering viewport...
});
# }
```

## Input handling

```
# async fn example() {
use app_window::input::{
    keyboard::{Keyboard, key::KeyboardKey},
    mouse::{Mouse, MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT}
};

// Create input handlers
let keyboard = Keyboard::coalesced().await;
let mut mouse = Mouse::coalesced().await;

// Check keyboard state
if keyboard.is_pressed(KeyboardKey::Space) {
    println!("Space key is pressed!");
}

// Check mouse state
if let Some(pos) = mouse.window_pos() {
    println!("Mouse at ({}, {})", pos.pos_x(), pos.pos_y());
}

if mouse.button_state(MOUSE_BUTTON_LEFT) {
    println!("Left mouse button is pressed!");
}

// Get scroll delta (clears after reading)
let (scroll_x, scroll_y) = mouse.load_clear_scroll_delta();
if scroll_y != 0.0 {
    println!("Scrolled vertically by {}", scroll_y);
}
# }
```

## Integrating with wgpu

For wgpu integration, use the platform-specific strategy:

```no_run
// ALLOW_NORUN_DOCTEST: Full wgpu example requires graphics setup beyond scope of doctest
# async fn example() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
use app_window::{window::Window, application, WGPU_STRATEGY, WGPUStrategy};

let mut window = Window::default().await;
let surface = window.surface().await;

// Use the appropriate strategy for your platform
match WGPU_STRATEGY {
    WGPUStrategy::MainThread => {
        application::on_main_thread("wgpu_init".to_string(), move || {
            // Create wgpu instance and surface on main thread
        }).await;
    }
    WGPUStrategy::NotMainThread => {
        // Create wgpu instance and surface on worker thread
    }
    WGPUStrategy::Relaxed => {
        // Create wgpu instance and surface on any thread
    }
    _ => {
        // Handle future strategies
    }
}
# Ok(())
# }
```

See `examples/gpu.rs` for a complete wgpu integration example.

# Platform Support

| Platform | Backend | Status | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| Windows  | Win32 API | ✅ Stable | Full async support, relaxed threading |
| macOS    | AppKit via Swift | ✅ Stable | Main thread UI, Swift interop |
| Linux    | Wayland | ✅ Stable | Client-side decorations, compositor-dependent |
| Web      | Canvas API | ✅ Stable | Requires atomics & bulk memory features |

# Performance Considerations

- **Lazy surface creation**: Surfaces are only allocated when requested via `window.surface()`
- **Input coalescing**: Input events can be coalesced for better performance in high-frequency scenarios
- **Efficient executor**: The main thread executor processes both async tasks and native events
- **Platform optimizations**: Each backend uses platform-specific optimizations

# Integration with Graphics APIs

The crate implements `raw-window-handle` traits, enabling integration with:
- **wgpu** (recommended, see `examples/gpu.rs`)
- **OpenGL/WebGL** via glutin or similar
- **Vulkan** via ash or vulkano
- **Metal** (macOS) via metal-rs
- **DirectX** (Windows) via windows-rs

/// Window creation and management.
///
/// This module provides the [`window::Window`] type for creating and managing windows
/// across different platforms. Windows can be created from any thread after the
/// application has been initialized.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # async fn example() {
/// use app_window::{window::Window, coordinates::{Position, Size}};
///
/// // Create a window with specific position and size
/// let window = Window::new(
///     Position::new(100.0, 100.0),

/// Application lifecycle and main thread management.
///
/// This module provides the entry point for app_window applications and utilities
/// for executing code on the main thread. The [`application::main`] function must
/// be called once from the first thread to initialize the platform event loop.
///
/// Key functions:
/// - [`application::main`] - Initialize the application and event loop
/// - [`application::on_main_thread`] - Execute async code on the main thread
/// - [`application::submit_to_main_thread`] - Fire-and-forget main thread tasks
///
/// Most functions in this module will panic if [`application::main`] hasn't been called yet.
/// [`application::main`] is called at the start of your program.
///
/// # Example
/// ```no_run
/// // ALLOW_NORUN_DOCTEST: application::main() must be called from the actual main thread, which is not available in doctests
/// use app_window::application;
///
/// fn main() {
///     application::main(|| {

///
/// This module provides [`coordinates::Position`] and [`coordinates::Size`] types

/// # Example
/// ```
/// use app_window::coordinates::{Position, Size};
///
/// let pos = Position::new(100.0, 200.0);
/// assert_eq!(pos.x(), 100.0);
/// assert_eq!(pos.y(), 200.0);
///

/// assert_eq!(size.width(), 800.0);
/// assert_eq!(size.height(), 600.0);
/// ```

///
/// This module provides the [`surface::Surface`] type, which represents a drawable
/// area within a window. Surfaces integrate with graphics APIs like wgpu through
/// the `raw-window-handle` trait implementations.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # async fn example() {
/// # use app_window::{application, window::Window};
/// let mut window = Window::default().await;
/// let surface = window.surface().await;
///
/// // Get size and scale factor
/// let (size, scale) = surface.size_scale().await;

/// Cross-platform mouse and keyboard input handling.
///
/// This module provides keyboard and mouse input functionality that integrates

/// # Example
/// ```
/// # async fn example() {

///
/// This module provides utilities for running futures on the main thread, which is

/// # Example
/// ```no_run
/// # // can't run on main thread in doctests
/// # use app_window::{application, executor};
/// # application::main(|| {
/// # async fn my_async_function() -> i32 { 42 }
/// // Run an async function on the main thread
/// let result = executor::on_main_thread_async("ex".to_owned(),my_async_function());
/// # });
/// ```

/// Integration with the `some_executor` crate.
///
/// This module provides [`some_executor::MainThreadExecutor`], which implements
/// the `SomeExecutor` and `SomeLocalExecutor` traits from the `some_executor` crate.
/// This allows the main thread executor to be used with any library that supports
/// the `some_executor` abstraction.

/// Thread-safe cell for main-thread-only values.
///
/// `MainThreadCell<T>` is a thread-safe container that allows `T` to be shared across threads
/// while ensuring all access to the inner value happens on the main thread.
/// This is useful for platform-specific resources that have main-thread requirements.
///
/// # Example
/// ```
/// # async fn example() {
/// use app_window::main_thread_cell::MainThreadCell;
///
/// // Create a cell (can be called from any thread)
/// let cell = MainThreadCell::new(42);
