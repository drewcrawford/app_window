//! Test to verify that the closure passed to app_window::application::main() actually executes.
//!
//! This test reproduces the bug where the closure passed to `application::main()` 
//! is never executed on WASM, causing the program to return immediately without
//! running the user's initialization code.
//!
//! Expected behavior:
//! - The closure should execute within a reasonable timeframe (500ms)
//! - Debug output should show "Inside app_window::application::main() closure"
//!
//! Bug behavior on WASM:
//! - The function returns immediately
//! - The closure is never executed
//! - We never see "Inside app_window::application::main() closure"
//!
//! Run with: `cargo test --test wasm_main_closure_execution_test`
